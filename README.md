# Drone-Controller
An Android application to control the basic drone movements. The application handles sending controller inputs over a WiFi connection
using UDP. While Wi-Fi is not an ideal method of communication for this type of application, I chose to use it simply because I thought it would be interesting and I haven't seen it done before.
